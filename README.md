#Vision Statement

Our project is a bartering app designed for anyone who owns items and wants to exchange them for other goods. Unlike traditional platforms like Facebook Marketplace or eBay, which primarily focus on monetary transactions, this app emphasizes trading and negotiation, offering users more flexibility and creativity in exchanging their belongings.
The app will allow users to create personalized accounts to manage trades and preferences. It will feature a streamlined interface to explore, search, and sort through various items, making it easy to find what they need—even discovering items they didn’t know they wanted. To ensure transparency and trust within the community, a reputation system will be implemented where users can rate and review one another based on past trades.
Additionally, the app will include a unique feature that enables users to sort items based on an estimated value range, without focusing solely on cash prices. This will allow for smoother negotiations between users seeking like-valued trades.
Ultimately, our app aims to make everyday bartering simple, fun, and cash-free, giving users the freedom to trade in a way that fits their individual needs.
