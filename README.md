# Bombastic

Our project is a bartering app designed for anyone who owns items and wants to exchange them for other goods. Many people seek alternatives to cash transactions for various reasons: they may prefer a more sustainable, resourceful way to obtain goods, have a surplus of items they no longer need, or enjoy the creativity and personal connection involved in negotiation. 
Our app emphasizes trading and negotiation, rather than money, offering users more flexibility and creativity in exchanging their belongings. 

This app will allow users to create personalized accounts to add items they no longer want or need, and trade them for items they do, all without the limitations of cash. It will feature a streamlined interface to explore, search, and sort through various items, making it easy to find what they need—and even discover items they didn’t know they wanted. To ensure transparency and trust within the community, a reputation system will be implemented where users can rate and review one another based on past trades. Additionally, the app will include a unique feature that enables users to sort items based on an estimated value range, without focusing solely on cash prices. This will allow for smoother negotiations between users seeking like-valued trades. Once a user expresses interest in another user’s item, they will be given the option to chat with each other, where they can share stories about their items, negotiate mutually beneficial deals, and explore creative ways to meet each other’s needs.

Compared to traditional online platforms like Facebook Marketplace or eBay, which focus primarily on buying and selling through monetary transactions, our bartering system offers a distinct advantage by removing the need for cash. These cash-based platforms can limit users who may not want to spend money or are unsure of the monetary value of their items. By focusing on trading instead, our app creates an environment where users can leverage their belongings, not their wallets
Ultimately, our app aims to make everyday bartering simple, fun, and cash-free, giving users the freedom to trade in a way that fits their individual needs.
