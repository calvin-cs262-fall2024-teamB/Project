Evelyn: As a college student who has lots of old textbooks and is still living on campus, 
I need to find someone who is interested in my textbooks so that I can clear up space and get something in return.

Landon: As an upperclassman moving off campus for the next school year, I need to get rid of my mini fridge
so that I don't have to take it with me to my new living arrangements.

Musa: As a college student in the dorms without much disposable money, I'm lookin for cool 
items that I could potentially trade my playstation for so that I can spice up my room.

Katelin: As a college student who doesn't have easy access to transportation, I need to find people around
my campus interested in getting rid of furniture to furnish my apartment.
