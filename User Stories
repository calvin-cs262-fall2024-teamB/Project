Evelyn: As a college student who has lots of old textbooks and is still living on campus, 
I need to find someone who is interested in my textbooks so that I can clear up space and get something in return.

Landon: As an upperclassman moving off campus for the next school year, I need to get rid of my mini fridge
so that I don't have to take it with me to my new living arrangements.
